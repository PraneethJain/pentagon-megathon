# Purpose:
We built an app, that can be used for **personality based classification** and qualification criteria for job interviews. The final results are 
calculated in a model trained with ML.

other phases of this **virtual interview**, based on **social media analysis** is calculated.

# Overview:
While building this app we've used **Android Studio** platform in **Kotlin** language.
